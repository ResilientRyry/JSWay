        <h3>Parity</h3>
        <p>Check the following program that shows even numbers (divisible by 2) between 1 and 10.</p>
        <p>for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {</p>
          <p>if (i % 2 === 0) {</p>
            <p>console.log(`${i} is even`);</p>
          <p>}</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>This program uses the modulo operator %, which calculates the remainder after division of one number by another. It's often used to assess number parity.</p>
        <p>console.log(10 % 2); // 0 because 10 = 5 * 2 + 0</p>
        <p>console.log(11 % 2); // 1 because 11 = 5 * 2 + 1</p>
        <p>console.log(18 % 3); // 0 because 18 = 3 * 6 + 0</p>
        <p>console.log(19 % 3); // 1 because 19 = 3 * 6 + 1</p>
        <p>console.log(20 % 3); // 2 because 20 = 3 * 6 + 2</p>
        <p>Improve the program so that it also shows odd numbers. Improve it again to replace the initial number 1 by a number given by the user.</p>
        <i>This program must show exactly 10 numbers including the first one, not 11 numbers!</i>
